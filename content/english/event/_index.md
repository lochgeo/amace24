    content: "Step back in time as we return to MACE for our 20th reunion! The afternoon kicks off with a meet and greet on campus, where you can reconnect with old friends and professors over light bites and drinks. We'll honour our favorite faculty members who made our college experience so memorable. Then, it's off to [Whispering Waters] (https://whisperingwaters.in/) for a lively evening of music and a delicious dinner. Catch up with classmates, share stories from the last 20 years, and make new memories. This is sure to be a reunion weekend you won't want to miss!"
